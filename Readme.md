# Retail Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focusing on practical applications of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning in retail data. Each notebook demonstrates a different use case and dataset:

---

## 1. Amazon Bestsellers Analysis (`Amazon1.ipynb`)

- **Objective**: Explore and analyze Amazon's bestselling books dataset to identify key patterns and build predictive models for book popularity.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Data cleaning and feature engineering
  - Descriptive analysis (trends, distributions, and correlations)
  - Visualizations of rating, price, and review patterns
  - Machine learning classification for bestseller prediction
- **Key Findings**:  
  The notebook provides insights into which factors contribute most to a book's sales performance and demonstrates how machine learning models can predict book popularity based on available features.

## 2. Brazilian Retail Data Analysis (`Brazial_retail.ipynb`)

- **Objective**: Analyze transaction-level retail data from Brazil to extract business insights and develop forecasting or classification models.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Exploratory data analysis (customer, product, and transaction patterns)
  - Visualization of sales trends and seasonality
  - (Optional) Predictive modeling for sales or customer behavior
- **Key Findings**:  
  The notebook uncovers trends and relationships in Brazilian retail markets, providing a foundation for further business analytics or machine learning applications.
